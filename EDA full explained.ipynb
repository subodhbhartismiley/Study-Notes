    "### b) Handling missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in the real world are rarely clean and homogeneous. Data can either be missing during data extraction or collection due to several reasons. Missing values need to be handled carefully because they reduce the quality of any of our performance metrics. It can also lead to wrong prediction or classification and can also cause a high bias for any given model being used. There are several options for handling missing values. However, the choice of what should be done is largely dependent on the nature of our data and the missing values. Below are some of the techniques:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### (i) Drop NULL or missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fastest and easiest step to handle missing values. However, it is not generally advised. This method reduces the quality of our model as it reduces sample size because it works by deleting all other observations where any of the variables are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python code :**\n",
    "\n",
    " dataset.dropna()\n",
    "\n",
    "####  (ii) Fill Missing Values:\n",

    "### c) Handling outliers:\n",

    "An outlier is something separate or different from the crowd. Outliers can be a result of a mistake during data collection or it can be just an indication of variance in your data. Some of the methods for detecting and handling outliers:\n",

    "A box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. The box extends from the Q1 to Q3 quartile values of the data, with a line at the median (Q2). The whiskers extend from the edges of the box to show the range of the data. Outlier points are those past the end of the whiskers. Box plots show robust measures of location and spread as well as providing information about symmetry and outliers.\n",

    "#### (ii) Scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is a mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables for a set of data. The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. The points that are far from the population can be termed as an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (iii) Z-score:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured. While calculating the Z-score we re-scale and center the data and look for data points that are too far from zero. These data points which are way too far from zero will be treated as the outliers. In most of the cases, a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",

    "dataset = dataset[(z < 3).all(axis=1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (iv) IQR:\n",
    "\n",
    "The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles.\n",

    "The Heat Map procedure shows the distribution of a quantitative variable over all combinations of 2 categorical factors. If one of the 2 factors represents time, then the evolution of the variable can be easily viewed using the map. A gradient color scale is used to represent the values of the quantitative variable. The correlation between two random variables is a number that runs from -1 through 0 to +1 and indicates a strong inverse relationship, no relationship, and a strong direct relationship, respectively."

This is a mistake with many implications, including generating inaccurate models, generating accurate models but on the wrong data, not creating the right types of variables in data preparation, and using resources inefficiently because of realizing only after generating models that perhaps the data is skewed, or has outliers, or has too many missing values, or finding that some values are inconsistent.\n",
